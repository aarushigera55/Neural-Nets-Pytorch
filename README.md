# Neural-Nets

This repo consists of deep learning models using PyTorch

### Installations for the repo

Command to install `pytorch` in your environment

1) For GPU:
> conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.0 -c pytorch

2) For CPU: 

> conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch

For all the packages used for the project, kindly look at the requirements.txt file


### Implementation

The implementation is divide into 2 stages

1) Stage 1:

`This stage consists of code for learnig pytorch, implementing perceptron using numpy and our first pytorch model
for KMNIST dataset`

2) Stage 2:

`Stage 2 consists of code relating to RNNs where implementation of LSTM, BiGRU is done on a
 sample of the whole IMDB dataset`

## Acknowledgement

I would like to thank Alan Blair and his team for supporting us with the materials and the templates 
required to learn pytorch in this repository as part of the course.
